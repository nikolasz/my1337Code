Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# 1st attempt:
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result = result ^ num
        return result

# Notes
# ^ is bitwise XOR
# XOR of a number with itself is 0
# XOR of a number with 0 is number itself
# XOR is associative and commutative

The XOR (Exclusive OR) operation is a logical operation that returns true if the number of true inputs is odd. In simpler terms, when comparing two bits, XOR returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

If a number appears twice, it will "cancel itself out" because XORing a number with itself results in 0.
The single number that appears only once won't be canceled, so it's left as the final result.
