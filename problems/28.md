Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.



Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

# 1st try
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if not needle:
            return 0

        needle_length = len(needle)

        for i in range(len(haystack) - needle_length + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+needle_length] == needle:
                return i

        return -1
```
## Intuition Notes
The problem essentially requires us to locate a smaller string (needle) within a larger string (haystack). A brute force approach would involve checking each character in the haystack against the needle - a computationally expensive process. The sliding window approach optimizes this by:

Limiting Comparisons: Rather than comparing every possible combination, you only compare substrings of the same length as the needle.
Efficiency: The sliding window moves one step at a time, so once a mismatch is found, it shifts and starts the comparison all over again. This ensures that we don't waste time checking impossible matches.
Early Termination: The loop doesn't go all the way to the end of the haystack; it stops earlier (length of haystack minus length of needle plus 1) to ensure the substring being checked isn't shorter than the needle.

## Syntax notes for noobies:
len() Function: Python's len() function provides the number of items in an object. In string contexts, it gives the number of characters. For example, len("abc") returns 3.
range() Function: The range() function is often used in loops to repeat an action a specific number of times. The parameters determine the start and end. For instance, range(0, 3) produces 0, 1, 2. In this problem, it ensures that we don't extract a substring shorter than the needle from the haystack.
String Slicing: In Python, strings are essentially arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. Thus, you can access parts of strings using array-like indexing with the slice [start:stop]. For instance, "hello"[1:4] extracts the substring "ell".

## Lessons Learned:
Sliding Window Technique: It's a versatile method in string and array manipulation problems, enabling efficient localized comparisons without the need for nested loops.
Boundary Management: Especially in string manipulation, ensuring that indices don't go out of bounds is crucial. Out-of-bounds errors can be common pitfalls. By adjusting the range of the loop, we avoid these pitfalls.
Early Returns: The solution uses an early return strategy. If the needle is an empty string, it immediately returns 0. Also, once a match is found, it returns instantly without checking the rest of the haystack. Such strategies can significantly optimize the code by reducing unnecessary computations.
Importance of Pre-computation: Before the main loop, the length of the needle is pre-computed and stored in a variable to prevent redundant calculations within the loop, enhancing efficiency.
